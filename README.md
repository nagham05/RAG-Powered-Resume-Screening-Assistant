#  RAG‑Powered Resume Screening Assistant

A **Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that allows users to upload resumes (PDFs), index them into a vector database, and ask natural‑language questions about their content through an interactive **Gradio web interface**.

This project demonstrates an **end‑to‑end RAG pipeline** combining document ingestion, embeddings, vector search (FAISS), and a Large Language Model (LLM) hosted on Hugging Face.

---

##  Project Overview

Traditional resume screening systems rely on keyword matching and rigid rules. This project uses **semantic search + LLM reasoning** to:

* Understand resumes beyond keywords
* Support conversational follow‑up questions
* Scale to multiple resumes using vector search

The system is designed as a **production‑style RAG application**, not just a notebook experiment.

*  **Semantic Resume Search (FAISS)**
*  **Conversational Q&A (Chat Interface)**
*  **Context‑Aware Responses (RAG)**
*  **Streaming LLM Responses**
*  **Notebook for Experimentation + Python App for Production**

Below is a screenshot of the running application showing the **resume screening analysis output** after providing job requirements. The interface allows users to enter job criteria, analyze multiple resumes, and view detailed, explainable decisions generated by the RAG pipeline.

##  Core Components Explained

### 1. Notebook: RAG Prototyping (`rag-testing.ipynb`)

The notebook is used for **research, experimentation, and validation** of the RAG pipeline before integrating it into the application.

It includes:
- Loading and parsing resume PDFs
- Chunking text with overlap
- Generating embeddings
- Building and querying a FAISS vector store
- Testing prompts and model responses

This notebook serves as the **development and learning environment** for the project.

---

### 2. Application Logic (`app.py`)

All production logic is consolidated into a single Python file for simplicity and clarity.

Responsibilities handled inside `app.py`:
- PDF upload handling
- Text chunking and embedding generation
- FAISS vector store creation and loading
- Semantic retrieval (top‑K relevant chunks)
- Prompt construction using retrieved context
- LLM invocation via Hugging Face Endpoint
- Streaming responses to the UI

This design reflects a **self‑contained RAG application**, suitable for demos and portfolio projects.



## Example Use Cases

* Resume screening & analysis
* Candidate shortlisting
* HR knowledge assistants
* Internal knowledge bases

---

## Why RAG (Retrieval‑Augmented Generation)?

* Prevents hallucination
* Grounds answers in real documents
* Scales to large document collections
* Industry‑standard architecture for LLM apps

---

## Tech Stack

* **Python 3.10+**
* **LangChain**
* **FAISS**
* **Sentence Transformers**
* **Hugging Face Inference API**
* **Gradio**
* **PyPDF**

---

## ⚠️ Important Usage Note (Local Resume Upload)

This project currently **does not support uploading resume PDFs directly through the web interface**.

* Resume PDFs **must be available locally** on the machine running the application.
* The application indexes resumes from the local file system as part of the RAG pipeline.
* This design choice keeps the project simple and focused on demonstrating **core RAG concepts** rather than file-storage infrastructure.

🔧 **Future improvement:** Add web-based resume upload and persistent storage for fully remote usage.

---

##  Limitations

* Uses remote LLM (internet required)
* Vectorstore stored locally (single‑machine)
* No user authentication (single session)
